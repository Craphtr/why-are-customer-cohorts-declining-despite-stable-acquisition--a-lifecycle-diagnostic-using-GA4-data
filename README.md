# 🧠 Executive Summary — Customer Acquisition Investigation

### Business Problem
Customer acquisition volume remains stable, yet overall customer quality appears to decline over time.

### 🔎 Investigation Path

| Investigation Step | Question Tested | Outcome |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| **1️⃣ Acquisition Quality** | Are some channels bringing lower-value customers? | ❌ No meaningful quality differences across channels |
| **2️⃣ Cohort Evolution** | Do newer customers behave differently over time? | ✅ Newer cohorts show weaker engagement |
| **3️⃣ Lifecycle Diagnosis** | What behavioral mechanism explains deterioration? | ✅ Customers increasingly fail to activate after first purchase |


### 📊 Executive KPI Snapshot

| Metric | Observation | Badge |
|--------|------------|-------|
| 📊 Avg Orders per Customer | Low engagement depth | ![Avg Orders](https://img.shields.io/badge/Avg%20Orders-1.30-blue) |
| 🔄 Repeat Purchase Rate | Weak retention | ![Repeat Rate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repeat%20Rate-18%25-green) |
| 🚫 One-Time Buyers | Dominant behavior pattern | ![One Time](https://img.shields.io/badge/One--Time%20Buyers-82%25-red) |
| 🏆 High-Value Customers | Small minority | ![Platinum](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platinum%20Share-~12%25-lightgrey) |



### 🎯 Final Diagnosis

Customer quality decline is **not caused by acquisition channel performance**.

The primary failure occurs **after acquisition**, where customers increasingly fail to transition beyond their first purchase.

**Root Cause:** Early lifecycle activation breakdown.



### 💼 Business Implication

Optimizing marketing spend alone will not reverse performance decline.

Impact is more likely achieved through:

- post-purchase engagement strategy
- onboarding and activation improvements
- early lifecycle retention interventions

# Problem Statement

Ecommerce companies frequently face a common challenge:

- Customer acquisition volume is increasing  
- Marketing strategy remains stable  
- Customer quality is declining  

This creates a critical ambiguity:

> Is acquisition failing, or are customers failing to **activate after acquisition**?

This project investigates **customer acquisition effectiveness** and the **deterioration of cohort quality** using the Google Analytics 4 (GA4) public BigQuery dataset.  

Because revenue is obfuscated in the GA4 sample data, customer value is assessed using a **behavioral definition**, focusing on engagement and purchase patterns.  

### **Objective:** 
Investigate and address the common problem of **deteriorating cohort quality**, by understanding behavioral and engagement patterns that drive customer value post-acquisition.  

The analysis follows a **sequential diagnostic approach**:

1. Evaluate acquisition channel quality  
2. Examine cohort behavior over time  
3. Diagnose lifecycle mechanisms driving deterioration  

This workflow demonstrates how structured analytics can **isolate the true driver** of declining customer quality.

# Data & Analytical Framework

**Source:** [Google Analytics 4 Obfuscated Ecommerce Dataset (BigQuery Public Data)](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/bigquery-public-data/ga4-obfuscated)  

### **Characteristics:**
- Event-level ecommerce tracking  
- 3 months of observable acquisition cohorts  
- Revenue values anonymized (near zero)  
- Partial channel attribution  
- No explicit CAC data  

### **Analytical Constraint:**  
Because monetary metrics are obfuscated, **customer value must be inferred using behavioral proxies**, mirroring real industry scenarios involving **privacy loss and incomplete attribution**.


All analyses follow a **repeatable product analytics workflow**:

Customer Lifecycle Stage  
⬇️ Primary Business Risk  
⬇️ Metric Family  
⬇️ Metric Table Schema  
⬇️ SQL Modeling  
⬇️ Decision Interpretation

### **Lifecycle Focus:** 
Customer Lifecycle Stage → Acquisition Economics  
**Note: Because revenue metrics are obfuscated, acquisition economics are inferred using behavioral proxies such as repeat purchase rate, average order per customer and value tier distribution.**

---

# Data Modeling

To enable cohort-level and customer-level analyses, a **customer-level analytical layer** (`customer360`) was constructed from raw event data. This layer aggregates behavioral signals to support **inference of customer value** in the absence of revenue metrics.

**Customer Grain:** One row per customer  

### **Core Fields**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `customerId` | Unique user identifier |
| `cohort_date` | Month of first purchase |
| `channel_group` | First acquisition channel |
| `total_orders` | Lifetime purchase count |
| `avg_order_value` | Mean order value proxy |
| `value_tier` | Behavioral customer tier |

### **Metric Definition: Behavioral Customer Value**

Since revenue is obfuscated in GA4, customer value is inferred using **engagement and purchasing behavior**. This approach mirrors real-world analytics scenarios where financial data is incomplete or unavailable.

### **Value Indicators**

- `avg_orders_per_customer` — overall purchase frequency  
- `repeat_purchase_rate` — likelihood of buying more than once  
- `pct_one_time_buyers` — share of single-purchase customers  
- `value tier distribution` — classification into Platinum/Gold/Silver/Bronze  
- `time to second purchase` — speed of customer activation  

### **High-Value Customers**

Customers are considered high-value if they:

- Purchase again after their first order  
- Purchase quickly (short time to second purchase)  
- Exhibit higher order frequency and engagement

# Analysis Step 1 — Testing Acquisition Channel Quality

---

### 🧭 Investigation Progress

`[ ANALYSIS STEP 1: Acquisition Quality ] → Cohort Evolution → Lifecycle Diagnosis → Root Cause`

--- 
Customer quality is declining despite stable acquisition strategy.

### **1st Working Hypothesis:** Some acquisition channels may be bringing lower quality customers. 

If true, reallocating marketing spend could solve performance decline.

--- 
Customers were evaluated using repeat behavior and value-tier distribution across channels.

 ### 📊 **Acquisition Quality KPI Summary**

### **Visualization:**  
![Analysis 1 - Acquisition Channel Quality](./visuals/01_Channel_Quality_trend.png)

### Key Results — Acquisition Channel Quality

| Channel Group | Customers | Avg Orders | Repeat Rate | Platinum % | Gold % | One-Time Buyers % |
|---------------|-----------|------------|-------------|------------|--------|------------------|
| Internal / Self Referral | 485 | 1.32 | 0.20 | 13% | 21% | 80% |
| Unattributed (Consent Loss) | 551 | 1.34 | 0.19 | 10% | 21% | 81% |
| Direct | 891 | 1.29 | 0.19 | 10% | 29% | 81% |
| Other / Unknown | 925 | 1.30 | 0.16 | 10% | 18% | 84% |
| Search (Paid/Organic) | 1214 | 1.25 | 0.16 | 9% | 21% | 84% |

### **Key Findings**

- Engagement depth is uniformly shallow across channels.
- Repeat purchase rates cluster tightly between 16 and 20%.
- Approximately 80% of customers purchase only once, regardless of acquisition source.
- Channel differences exist but are marginal relative to overall behavioral patterns.

### **Interim Insight**
Customer behavior converges toward the same outcome independent of acquisition source.

This indicates the business is successfully acquiring customers but struggling to retain them.
The performance constraint appears post-acquisition, not in marketing mix.

### **Hypothesis Status:** ❌ Acquisition channels are NOT the primary driver of declining Customer Quality.

### **Decision - Next Hypothesis:**  
If acquisition quality is stable, cohort deterioration must occur after customers enter the lifecycle.

Next Step: Analyze how customer cohorts evolve over time.

---

# Analysis Step 2 — Cohort Evolution

---

### 🧭 Investigation Progress

Acquisition Quality → `[ ANALYSIS STEP 2: Cohort Evolution ]` → Lifecycle Diagnosis → Root Cause
Acquisition channels were found not to explain declining customer quality.
This step evaluates whether behavioral quality changes across customer cohorts over time.

---
### **2nd Working Hypothesis:** Customer behavior deteriorates across newer acquisition cohorts.

If true, the decline originates after acquisition and indicates structural changes in customer engagement.

---
Customers were grouped by **first purchase month** to observe behavioral evolution.

### 📊 Cohort Evolution KPI Summary

| KPI | Value | Badge |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 🔄 Repeat Purchase Rate | 16% | ![Repeat Rate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repeat%20Rate-16%25-green) |
| 📊 Avg Orders per Customer | 1.26 | ![Avg Orders](https://img.shields.io/badge/Avg%20Orders-1.26-blue) |
| 🚫 One-Time Buyers | 84% | ![One Time Buyers](https://img.shields.io/badge/One--Time%20Buyers-84%25-red) |
| 🏆 High-Value Tier Share (Platinum + Gold) | ~31% | ![High Value Share](https://img.shields.io/badge/High--Value%20Customers-31%25-lightgrey) |
| 📡 Acquisition Mix Stability | Stable | ![Channel Mix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Channel%20Mix-Stable-purple) |

These metrics evaluate whether customer engagement depth and value composition change across acquisition cohorts over time.

### **Visualization:**  
![Analysis 2 - Cohort Evolution](./visuals/02_Cohort_Evolution.png)

### **Key Results**


### **Key Findings**  
- Customer volume expanded from November to December before declining in January, indicating mid-period acquisition scaling.
- Behavioral depth weakened progressively across cohorts:
  - repeat purchase rate declined,
  - average orders decreased,
  - one-time buyers increased.
- High-value customers (Platinum + Gold) shrank while lower-value tiers expanded, indicating structural quality deterioration rather than random variation.
- Acquisition channel mix remained stable across cohorts, confirming deterioration is not marketing-channel driven.

### **Interim Insight**
Earlier cohorts demonstrated stronger engagement and value concentration, establishing a baseline of efficient acquisition.
As acquisition scaled, customer depth declined — suggesting growth shifted from quality-driven acquisition toward volume expansion.

This pattern signals acquisition dilution, where newer customers enter the lifecycle with weaker long-term engagement potential.

### **Economic Implication**
If this trajectory continues:
- Future customer lifetime value (LTV) will compress.
- Growth may appear healthy through rising customer counts while retention weakens underneath.
- Revenue expansion risks masking deteriorating unit economics and rising churn exposure.

### **Hypothesis Status:** ✅ Customer behavior worsens across newer cohorts.

### **Decision - Next Hypothesis**
Since deterioration occurs after acquisition and progressively across time, the next step is to identify where in the customer lifecycle engagement breaks down.

Next Step: Diagnose lifecycle-stage friction driving retention collapse.

![Analysis 3 - Activation Speed and Coverage](./visuals/04_Activation_Speed_and_Coverage_Chart.png)


### **Key Findings & Diagnostic Insight**

- **Behavioral quality collapse:** Repeat purchase rate dropped from 78% → 16% across cohorts; one-time buyers surged from 71% → 94%.  
- **High-value tier erosion:** Platinum customers fell from 24% → 8%; gold remained stable; silver and bronze increased.  
- **Activation failure as root cause:** Most customers who do repeat purchase do so quickly (within 7–30 days), but the **activation probability is low** — fewer customers enter the repeat journey.  
- **Structural deterioration:** Later cohorts contain more one-time buyers and fewer high-value customers, confirming that **cohort quality deterioration occurs early in the lifecycle**.  
- **Acquisition channels remain stable:** Channel mix shows no meaningful change, so deterioration is **not driven by marketing** but by early lifecycle activation failure. 

### Economic Implication

- Activation failure compresses future **customer lifetime value** while acquisition costs remain unchanged.  
- Apparent customer growth masks declining **unit economics**.  
- Misdiagnosing the problem as acquisition-driven could lead to **inefficient marketing spend, channel reallocations, and incorrect CAC optimization**.  
- If unresolved: margin erosion accelerates, revenue growth becomes increasingly dependent on continuous acquisition, and high churn dominates newer cohorts.


### Decision Interpretation

- **Root cause:** Early lifecycle failure — insufficient activation after first purchase.  
- **Implication:** Post-purchase experience is the true leverage point, not acquisition strategy.  
- **Observation:** Customers who activate repeat quickly (7–30 days) are high-value; most newer users fail to reach this stage.


### Recommendation to Management

1. **Introduce Activation Metrics as Core KPIs**  
   Track second-purchase conversion rather than first-order revenue.  

2. **Strengthen Early Lifecycle Engagement (first 7–30 days)**  
   - Personalized post-purchase communication  
   - Product discovery reinforcement  
   - Targeted retention incentives  

3. **Evaluate Acquisition by Behavioral Outcomes**  
   Optimize campaigns based on repeat purchase formation, not first-order conversion alone.  
   Run activation experiments **before increasing acquisition spend**.

> Improving activation conversion will increase **customer lifetime value** more efficiently than reallocating marketing channels or expanding acquisition volume.
