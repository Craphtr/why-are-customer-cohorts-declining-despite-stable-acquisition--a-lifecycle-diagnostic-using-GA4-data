# 🧠 Executive Summary — Customer Acquisition Investigation

### Business Problem
Customer acquisition volume remains stable, yet overall customer quality appears to decline over time.

### 🔎 Investigation Path

| Investigation Step | Question Tested | Outcome |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| **1️⃣ Acquisition Quality** | Are some channels bringing lower-value customers? | ❌ No meaningful quality differences across channels |
| **2️⃣ Cohort Evolution** | Do newer customers behave differently over time? | ✅ Newer cohorts show weaker engagement |
| **3️⃣ Lifecycle Diagnosis** | What behavioral mechanism explains deterioration? | ✅ Customers increasingly fail to activate after first purchase |


### 📊 Executive KPI Snapshot

| Metric | Observation | Badge |
|--------|------------|-------|
| 📊 Avg Orders per Customer | Low engagement depth | ![Avg Orders](https://img.shields.io/badge/Avg%20Orders-1.30-blue) |
| 🔄 Repeat Purchase Rate | Weak retention | ![Repeat Rate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repeat%20Rate-18%25-green) |
| 🚫 One-Time Buyers | Dominant behavior pattern | ![One Time](https://img.shields.io/badge/One--Time%20Buyers-82%25-red) |
| 🏆 High-Value Customers | Small minority | ![Platinum](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platinum%20Share-~12%25-lightgrey) |



### 🎯 Final Diagnosis

Customer quality decline is **not caused by acquisition channel performance**.

The primary failure occurs **after acquisition**, where customers increasingly fail to transition beyond their first purchase.

**Root Cause:** Early lifecycle activation breakdown.



### 💼 Business Implication

Optimizing marketing spend alone will not reverse performance decline.

Impact is more likely achieved through:

- post-purchase engagement strategy
- onboarding and activation improvements
- early lifecycle retention interventions

# Problem Statement

Ecommerce companies frequently face a common challenge:

- Customer acquisition volume is increasing  
- Marketing strategy remains stable  
- Customer quality is declining  

This creates a critical ambiguity:

> Is acquisition failing, or are customers failing to **activate after acquisition**?

This project investigates **customer acquisition effectiveness** and the **deterioration of cohort quality** using the Google Analytics 4 (GA4) public BigQuery dataset.  

Because revenue is obfuscated in the GA4 sample data, customer value is assessed using a **behavioral definition**, focusing on engagement and purchase patterns.  

### **Objective:** 
Investigate and address the common problem of **deteriorating cohort quality**, by understanding behavioral and engagement patterns that drive customer value post-acquisition.  

The analysis follows a **sequential diagnostic approach**:

1. Evaluate acquisition channel quality  
2. Examine cohort behavior over time  
3. Diagnose lifecycle mechanisms driving deterioration  

This workflow demonstrates how structured analytics can **isolate the true driver** of declining customer quality.

# Data & Analytical Framework

**Source:** [Google Analytics 4 Obfuscated Ecommerce Dataset (BigQuery Public Data)](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/bigquery-public-data/ga4-obfuscated)  

### **Characteristics:**
- Event-level ecommerce tracking  
- 3 months of observable acquisition cohorts  
- Revenue values anonymized (near zero)  
- Partial channel attribution  
- No explicit CAC data  

### **Analytical Constraint:**  
Because monetary metrics are obfuscated, **customer value must be inferred using behavioral proxies**, mirroring real industry scenarios involving **privacy loss and incomplete attribution**.


All analyses follow a **repeatable product analytics workflow**:

Customer Lifecycle Stage  
⬇️ Primary Business Risk  
⬇️ Metric Family  
⬇️ Metric Table Schema  
⬇️ SQL Modeling  
⬇️ Decision Interpretation

### **Lifecycle Focus:** 
Customer Lifecycle Stage → Acquisition Economics  
**Note: Because revenue metrics are obfuscated, acquisition economics are inferred using behavioral proxies such as repeat purchase rate, average order per customer and value tier distribution.**

---

# Data Modeling

To enable cohort-level and customer-level analyses, a **customer-level analytical layer** (`customer360`) was constructed from raw event data. This layer aggregates behavioral signals to support **inference of customer value** in the absence of revenue metrics.

**Customer Grain:** One row per customer  

### **Core Fields**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `customerId` | Unique user identifier |
| `cohort_date` | Month of first purchase |
| `channel_group` | First acquisition channel |
| `total_orders` | Lifetime purchase count |
| `avg_order_value` | Mean order value proxy |
| `value_tier` | Behavioral customer tier |

### **Metric Definition: Behavioral Customer Value**

Since revenue is obfuscated in GA4, customer value is inferred using **engagement and purchasing behavior**. This approach mirrors real-world analytics scenarios where financial data is incomplete or unavailable.

### **Value Indicators**

- `avg_orders_per_customer` — overall purchase frequency  
- `repeat_purchase_rate` — likelihood of buying more than once  
- `pct_one_time_buyers` — share of single-purchase customers  
- `value tier distribution` — classification into Platinum/Gold/Silver/Bronze  
- `time to second purchase` — speed of customer activation  

### **High-Value Customers**

Customers are considered high-value if they:

- Purchase again after their first order  
- Purchase quickly (short time to second purchase)  
- Exhibit higher order frequency and engagement

### Key Results — Acquisition Channel Quality

| Channel Group | Customers | Avg Orders | Repeat Rate | Platinum % | One-Time Buyers % |
|---------------|-----------|------------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| Internal / Self Referral | 485 | 1.32 | 0.20 | 0.13 | 0.80 |
| Unattributed (Consent Loss) | 551 | 1.34 | 0.19 | 0.10 | 0.81 |
| Direct | 891 | 1.29 | 0.19 | 0.10 | 0.81 |
| Other / Unknown | 925 | 1.30 | 0.16 | 0.10 | 0.84 |
| Search (Paid/Organic) | 1214 | 1.25 | 0.16 | 0.09 | 0.84 |

**Key Finding:**  
- Engagement is shallow coupled with a weak retention. 
- Activation Failure is high with the dominant behavioral pattern being one-time purchasing.
- Channel performance differences exist — but they are small relative to the structural issue.

**Implication:**  
The quality of customers is broadly similar across all channels, with minor behavioral advantages in Internal and Direct traffic. However, across all channels, approximately 80% of customers purchase only once, indicating that retention—not acquisition mix—is the primary performance constraint. Strategic focus should shift toward post-purchase engagement rather than channel reallocation.

## 🧭 Investigation Progress

**Customer Quality Decline Investigation**

Acquisition Quality → `[ STEP 2: Cohort Evolution ]` → Lifecycle Diagnosis → Root Cause

**Current Objective:** Determine whether customer behavior changes across acquisition cohorts over time.

---
Customers were grouped by **first purchase month**.

**Metrics Examined:**

- Repeat purchase rate  
- Average order frequency  
- Value tier migration  
- Acquisition mix stability  

**Finding:**  
Later cohorts demonstrated:

- Higher one-time buyer share  
- Lower repeat behavior  
- Reduced engagement depth  

Customer quality **degraded progressively** after acquisition.

**Visualization:**  
![Analysis 2 - Cohort Evolution](./visualizations/cohort_evolution.png)

## 🧭 Investigation Progress

**Customer Quality Decline Investigation**

Acquisition Quality → Cohort Evolution → `[ STEP 3: Lifecycle Diagnosis ]` → Root Cause

**Current Objective:** Identify the behavioral mechanism causing cohort deterioration.

---

**Diagnostic Dimensions:**

- **Acquisition Stability:** Channel mix remained largely constant  
- **Behavioral Change:** Time to second purchase increased, repeat purchase probability declined  
- **Activation Failure:** Customers increasingly failed to transition beyond first purchase  

**Core Insight:**  
The business problem is **not acquisition efficiency** — it is an **early lifecycle activation breakdown**. Marketing optimization alone would **not solve performance decline**.
