# 🟠Simulated Consulting Engagement: Ecommerce Cohort Quality Diagnostic
TechCraphters Strategic Analytics | Portfolio Case Study

## 📋 Engagement Simulation Context
#### **Scenario:** Fortune 500 Ecommerce Retailer
#### **Role:** Lead Analytics Consultant (Simulated)
#### **Duration:** 6 weeks
#### Stakeholder:** Chief Marketing Officer & VP of Customer Retention

# **Business Situation (Simulated)**
This case study simulates a strategic diagnostic engagement using the Google Analytics 4 public dataset. The business context, stakeholder dynamics, and strategic stakes are modeled on typical enterprise engagements I have observed or participated in, while all data and specific outcomes are derived from public sources.

#### **Simulated Mandate:**
A client's acquisition volume has grown 34% YoY, yet quarterly revenue growth lags at 12%. The CMO must decide whether to approve a 40% increase in Q2 acquisition spend. My objective is to determine whether declining performance stems from acquisition source degradation or post-acquisition activation failure.

#### **Analytical Constraint:**
Revenue values are obfuscated in the GA4 dataset, requiring behavioral proxy methodology—a common real-world scenario where financial data resides in separate systems or requires legal clearance.

>#### **Consulting Approach:**
I deliberately chose this constraint to demonstrate how I operate when perfect data is unavailable. In actual engagements, I frequently architect analytics strategies across data silos, using behavioral inference when revenue data is inaccessible. This simulation showcases that capability.

# 🎯 Executive Summary
#### **The Board Question**
"We're acquiring more customers than ever. Why isn't revenue accelerating?"

#### **Diagnostic Conclusion**
Customer quality decline is not an acquisition problem. It is an activation crisis.
In this simulated scenario, the 40% acquisition increase should be conditionally declined pending resolution of early-lifecycle retention failure.
