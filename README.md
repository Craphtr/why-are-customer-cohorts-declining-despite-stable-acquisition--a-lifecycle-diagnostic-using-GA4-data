## Overview

This project investigates **customer acquisition effectiveness** and **cohort quality deterioration** for an ecommerce business using the Google Analytics 4 (GA4) public BigQuery dataset.

Rather than relying on revenue (obfuscated in GA4 sample data), this analysis applies a **behavioral definition of customer value**, replicating how product analytics teams diagnose acquisition performance under **imperfect real-world data constraints**.

**Objective:** Answer three acquisition-stage business questions:

1. Which acquisition channels bring **high-value customers**?  
2. How do **customer characteristics evolve over time**?  
3. Why are **newer customer cohorts deteriorating** despite stable acquisition strategy?  

---

## Business Context

Ecommerce companies frequently observe:

- Increasing customer acquisition volume  
- Stable marketing strategy  
- Declining customer quality  

This creates a critical ambiguity:

> Is acquisition failing, or are customers failing to **activate after acquisition**?

This project demonstrates a structured analytical workflow to **isolate the true driver**.

## Dataset

**Source:** [Google Analytics 4 Obfuscated Ecommerce Dataset (BigQuery Public Data)](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/bigquery-public-data/ga4-obfuscated)  

**Characteristics:**

- Event-level ecommerce tracking  
- 3 months of observable acquisition cohorts  
- Revenue values anonymized (near zero)  
- Partial channel attribution  
- No explicit CAC data  

**Analytical Constraint:**  

Because monetary metrics are obfuscated, **customer value must be inferred using behavioral proxies**, mirroring real industry scenarios involving **privacy loss and incomplete attribution**.

## Analytical Framework

All analyses follow a **repeatable product analytics workflow**:
